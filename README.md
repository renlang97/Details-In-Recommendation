## Recommender

Most of models are implement with **customed estimator** which is high-level tensorflow API. It is easy for distributed training and can export saved model for tensorflow serving to predict online.

## MODEL

### Deep Factorization-Machine (DeepFM)
>DeepFM: A Factorization-Machine based Neural Network for CTR Prediction
* high-level tensorflow api (estimator, feature_column etc.)
* support multi-hot feature. e.g. user history purchased items sequence.


### Deep Cross Network (DCN)

>Deep & Cross Network (DCN) keeps the benefits of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions.


### Entire Space Multi-Task Model (ESMM)
